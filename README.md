# SectorsEdgeStreamControl
### Let your Twitch Stream control your Sector's Edge gameplay!

I'm going to make this work with my specific binds, so do change then - and the chat commands themselves.
This might be annoying to do - sorry! 

## Setup

1. **Download all the files.** 

You can click on the green "Code" button at the top right, and then click on "Download ZIP".

2. **Install the dependencies.**
Make sure you have Python 3.3 or newer installed.

Also install AutoHotKey from their official website.

Run the following command in your terminal:
`pip install ahk` 

3. **Input your Twitch account details.**

IDK I'll make a file and tutorial for this when I code that part.

4. **Run the program** by running `python main.py` in your terminal.
